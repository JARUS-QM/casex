============

The mathematical models implemented in the package are the results of the
combined effort of the Quantitative Methods subgroup under Working Group 6 in JARUS.
The effort is a combination of gathering and unifying existing models and of
developing models adapted to the specific needs of Annex F, including the JARUS
critical area model and the obstacle model.

The group has the following core members:

* Terrence Martin (chair), Queensland University of Technology, Australia
* Henri Hohtari, AirMap, Switzerland
* Tony Nannini, Wing, USA
* JÃ¶rg Dittrich, DLR, Germany
* Anders la Cour-Harbo, Aalborg University, Denmark
* Thomas Putland, TASDCRC, Australia

The group has used various tools
for developing the mathematical content of Annex F, including Matlab and Python.
CasEx is a publicly available, streamlined, fully documented version of this work,
and it can be installed as any other Python package.

The development of CasEx as a Python package was done by:

Lead programmer and math modelling
   Anders la Cour-Harbo
Math modelling and Matlab implementations
   Terrence Martin
Math support
   Thomas Putland
Documentation layout and package integration
   Christian Schmidt Godiksen
